## Epics
A large story or scenario that guides the creation of the software product. Epics usually cover a particular persona and give an overall idea of what is important to the user. An epic can be further broken down in various user stories that show individual tasks that a persona/user would like to perform.

### Epic Example
In an application what helps freelance painters track their projects a possible epic could be.

Paul the Painter loves painting but finds it hard to track all the various colours that are in use in various projects. He usually works best with a colour palette which is sometimes provided by the client in terms of colour codes or via pictures or he takes the pictures on his cellphone and uses a colour picker application to choose the colours. After he has a full colour palette he then orders the appropriate colours and keeps his receipts neatly to claim back his expenses. Once a project is complete he would take a picture of the room with a before and after and attaches it to the invoice and gives it to the client.
